for i in range(len(workday)):
        hours=int(input(f"enter in the hours you worked #{i+1}:")) #i will increse by one untill it hits 5
        hoursworked.append(hours)
        

totalhours =sum (hoursworked) #totalhours and averagehours
average = totalhours/5

print(f"the total hours within in the week is {totalhours}")
